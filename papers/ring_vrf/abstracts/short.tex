We introduce a new cryptographic primitive,  named
\emph{ring verifiable random function (ring VRF)}. Ring VRF combines properties of VRF  and ring signatures, offering verifiable unique, pseudorandom outputs while ensuring  anonymity of the output and message authentication. We design its security in the universal composability (UC) framework and construct two protocols secure in our model.
We also formalize a new notion of \emph{zero-knowledge (ZK) continuations} allowing for the reusability of proofs by randomizing and enhancing the efficiency of one of our ring VRF schemes. We instantiate this notion with our protocol $ \SpecialG $
which allows a prover to reprove a statement in a constant time and be unlikable to the previous proof(s).

%Ring VRF is a ring signature that proves a correct evaluation
%of a random, while hiding the signer's
%identity within a ring, some set of possible signers. We design a ring VRF protocol which has efficient instantiations with our novel {\em zero-knowledge continuation} technique.

%We demonstrate a {\em zero-knowledge continuation} technique,
%which works by adjusting a Groth16 trusted setup to hide public inputs
%when rerandomizing the Groth16, ensuring that muliple uses of a proof generated once are unlinkable.  We then build ring VRFs that amortizes
%expensive ring membership proofs across many ring VRF signatures.
%%
%Our ring VRF needs only eight $\mathcal{G}_1$ and two
%$\mathcal{G}_2$ scalar multiplications, making it the only ring signature
%with performance competitive with group signatures.
%
%A ring VRF can be used to obtain a unique pseudo-anonymous identity from a given a list of identities.
%By using a different input for the ring VRF in different contexts, we can generate a pseudonym for each context that is unlinkable between different contexts. 
%We discuss applications that range across the anonymous credential space.

%Ring VRFs produce a unique identity for any given context but remain
%unlinkable between different contexts.  These unlinkable but unique
%pseudonyms provide a far better balance between user privacy and service
%provider or social interests than attribute based credentials like IRMA credentials.
%Ring VRFs also support anonymously rationing or rate limiting resource
%consumption that winds up vastly more flexible and efficient than
%purchases via money-like protocols.

%We define the security of ring VRFs in the universally composable (UC) model and show that our protocol is UC secure.
