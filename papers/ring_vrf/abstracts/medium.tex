We introduce a new cryptographic primitive, named
 \emph{ring verifiable random functions (ring VRF)},
 which provides an array of uses, especially in anonymous credentials.

Ring VRFs are ring signatures that prove correct evaluation
of an authorized signer's pseudoramdom function, while hiding the signer's
identity within some set of possible signers.

We present a family of ring VRF protocols with surprisingly efficient
instantiations, due to our novel {\em zero-knowledge continuation} technique.
Intuitively our ring VRF signers generate two linked proofs, an inexpensive
 one for PRF evaluation and one for ring membership, which can be reused. 
%An evaluation proof needs only a cheap Chaum-Pedersen DLEQ proof.
%, while ring membership proof depends only upon the ring itself.
We reuse the ring membership proof across multiple inputs
by expanding a Groth16 trusted setup to re-hide public inputs when
 rerandomizing the Groth16, ensuring that these reuses of the same proof are unlinkable.
Our fastest amortized ring VRF needs only eight $\mathcal{G}_1$
 and two $\mathcal{G}_2$ scalar multiplications, 
making it the only ring signature with performance competitive with group signatures.

A ring VRF can be used to obtain a unique pseudo-anonymous identity from a given a list of identities.
By using a different input for the ring VRF in different contexts, we can generate a pseudonym for each context that is unlinkable between different contexts. We discuss applications that range across the anonymous credential space.

%We discuss applications that range across the anonymous credential space:As in proof-of-personhood work by  Bryan Ford, et al., a ring VRF output acts like a unique pseudo-anonymous identity within some desired context, given as the ring VRF input, but remains unlinkable between different contexts. These unlinkable but unique pseudonyms provide a better balance between user privacy and service provider or social interests than attribute based credentials like IRMA (``I Reveal My Attributes'') credentials.

%Ring VRFs support anonymously rationing or rate limiting resource
%consumption that winds up vastly more flexible and efficient than
%purchases via money-like protocols.

We define the security of ring VRFs in the universally composable (UC) model and show that our protocol is UC secure.
