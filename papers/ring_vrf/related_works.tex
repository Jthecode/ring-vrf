The unique ring signature framework \cite{URCframework} is the closest model to our ring VRF framework particularly in terms of the presence of a deterministic component known as the unique identifier for the signed message. This identifier remains constant for the same signed message even when the ring changes.  Essentially, the unique identifier in the unique ring signature model and the ring VRF evaluation value function equivalently in both models. However, a fundamental distinction lies in the treatment of this identifier. In our ring VRF model, we impose the requirement of pseudorandomness, as defined in \cite{ucvrf,praos}, on this unique identifier, even in the case of malicious parties. This requirement holds significant importance in specific applications of ring VRF, such as lotteries or leader elections, where the unique identifier plays a privileged or reward-based role based on predefined conditions. Another definitional difference is that a ring VRF  signature not only prove the correctness of the evaluation value of an input but also signs an auxiliary data independent from the input. This property is crucial, especially for anonymous access mechanisms, as illustrated in the introduction. Without it, such protocols are susceptible to replay attacks unless auxiliary data effectively binds the ring VRF signature to e.g., a TLS session.
The signature size of unique ring signature schemes scales either linearly \cite{URCframework,URCfc} or logarithmically  \cite{URCblockchainprivacy,URClattice} with the size of the ring. In contrast, our ring VRF constructions maintain a constant signature size while providing stronger security guarantees. In addition to this, our signing and verification algorithms show superior asymptotic scalability compared to existing unique ring signatures because they operate with the commitment to the ring, which maintains a constant size.

Other related security models are linkable ring signature \cite{ring_linkable,ring_linkablee} and traceable ring signature \cite{traceable07,traceable_sub}. Linkable ring signatures lets a third party to link whether two ring signatures of two inputs are signed by the same party in the same ring without revealing the identity. This type of linkability property is valuable in applications that impose restrictions on authentications, such as preventing double spending or multiple voting. However, both Ring VRF and unique ring signature schemes do not necessitate this linkability property, as they already provide a unique identifier to each party for each context, automatically revealing more than one authentication. Traceable ring signatures disclose the identity of the signer when the signer generates two signatures for two different inputs within the same ring and from the same issuer. Additionally, akin to Ring VRF and unique ring signatures, if a signer signs the same message twice for the same ring and issuer, it becomes evident that both signatures are produced by the same party, although the specific party's identity remains secret.
