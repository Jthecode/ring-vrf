The unique ring signature framework \cite{URCframework} is the closest model to our ring VRF framework particularly in terms of the presence of a deterministic component known as the unique identifier for the signed message. This identifier remains constant for the same signed message even when the ring changes.  Essentially, the unique identifier in the unique ring signature model and the ring VRF evaluation value function equivalently in both models. However, a fundamental distinction lies in the treatment of this identifier. In our ring VRF model, we impose the requirement of pseudorandomness, as defined in \cite{ucvrf,praos}, on this unique identifier, even in the case of malicious parties.
This requirement is crucial for applications such as lotteries or leader elections where the unique identifier plays a privileged or reward-based role based on predefined conditions. Another definitional difference is that a ring VRF  signature not only prove the correctness of the evaluation value of an input but also signs an auxiliary data independent from the input. This property is needed for anonymous access mechanisms to prevent replay attacks because auxiliary data can be used to effectively bind the ring VRF signature to e.g., a TLS session.
The signature size of unique ring signature schemes scales either linearly \cite{URCframework,URCfc} or logarithmically  \cite{URCblockchainprivacy,URClattice} with the size of the ring. In contrast, our ring VRF constructions maintain a constant signature size while providing stronger security guarantees. Also our signing and verification algorithms show better asymptotic scalability compared to existing unique ring signatures because they operate with a constant-size  commitment to the ring.

Other related security models are linkable ring signature \cite{ring_linkable,ring_linkablee} and traceable ring signature \cite{traceable07,traceable_sub}. Linkable ring signatures lets a third party to link whether two ring signatures of two inputs are signed by the same party in the same ring without revealing the identity. This type of linkability property is valuable in applications that impose restrictions on authentications, such as preventing double spending or multiple voting. Akin to ring VRF and unique ring signatures, if a signer signs the same message twice for the same ring and issuer, it becomes evident that both signatures are produced by the same party, although the specific party's identity remains secret. Both ring VRF and unique ring signature schemes have this property in a single context, through the unique idetifier for each party in this context, but do not provide linkability across contexts.
 Traceable ring signatures disclose the identity of the signer when the signer generates two signatures for two different inputs within the same ring and from the same issuer.

The most related construction is Semaphore\cite{sempaphore}, which also provides a "nullifier", unique per identity and context but anonymous, (akin to a ring VRF output in our formalism) along with a signature on a message. The properties this construction satisfies are not fully formalised. UC technicalities prevent this from satisfying our definition of a ring VRF. We expect our constructions have better proving time because it proves less in the SNARK as well as allowing proof reuse.

ZK Continuations are an example of the commit and prove approach\cite{LegoSNARKs}, linking SNARKs in a way similar to the ccGroth16 construction from LegoSNARKS\cite{LegoSNARKs}. We prove that a very similar construction has the property that one of the SNARKs proofs can be resued in zero knowledge for which we provide new formalism.
