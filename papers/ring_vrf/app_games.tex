% TODO: Games part
% Although our examples fit this poorly, we could choose $N$ large and
% then reject many $\Ou$, so that statistically all users recieved the
% desired number of accepted $\Ou$.
% If so, we decrease the odds that $k_1 = k_2$ by
%  increasing $N$ and decreasing odds of accepting some $\Out$.
