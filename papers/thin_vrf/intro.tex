There are VRFs built upon Chaum-Pedersen DLEQ proofs in elliptic curves,
like \cite{nsec5} and \cite{VXEd25519} and \cite{draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-10}.
Yet typically their proofs have one challenge scalar and one signature
scalar, like a non-batchable Schnorr signature, while
their verification demands two elliptic curve multi-exponentiations.
As a result, their naively batchable variant becomes ``fat'', requiring
one scalar and two separate nonces, which complicates batch verification
and interfaces.

We propose a new thin(er batchable EC) VRF called \ThinVRF that merges
these two nonces, and needs only one elliptic curve multi-exponentiation
in verification.  \ThinVRF amounts to a Schnorr signature with its
base point, nonce, and public key terms all replaced by a pseudo-random
linear combination of the corresponding points in the two verification
equations of the usual fat EC VRF.

Aside from slightly improving verifier time, \ThinVRF simplifies
the interfaces for batch verification or half-aggregation \cite{???},
without altering the signature or increasing the signature size.
