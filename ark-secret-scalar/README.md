## Arkworks secret scalar handling via key splitting

Secret scalar split into the sum of two scalars, which randomly
mutate but retain the same sum.   Incurs 2x penalty in scalar
multiplications, but provides side channel defenses.
 
We support `&self` recievers throughout, like typical secret keys do.
We choose non-thread-safe interior mutability vis `UnsafeCell` which
avoids atomics, but makes `SecretScalar` only `Send` but `!Sync`.

As `Mutex<T: Send>: Send+Sync`, one should prefer `Mutex<SecretKey>`
over cloning `SecretScalar`, simply to minimize clones of secret keys.
